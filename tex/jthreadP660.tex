\section*{{\huge{}A Cooperatively Interruptible Joining Thread, Rev 4}}

\subsubsection*{New in R4}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Removed interruptible CV waiting members that don't take a predicate.
 \item Removed adding a new \tcode{cv_status} value \tcode{interrupted}.
 \item Added CV members for interruptible timed waits.
 \item Renamed CV members that wait interruptible.
 \item Several minor fixes (e.g. on \tcode{noexcept}) and full proposed wording.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Purpose}

This is the proposed wording for a cooperatively interruptible joining thread.

For a full discussion fo the motivation, see
\url{www.wg21.link/p0660r0} and
\url{www.wg21.link/p0660r1}.

A default implementation exists at:
\url{github.com/josuttis/jthread}.
Note that the proposed functionality can be fully implemented 
on top of the existing C++ standard library.

Basis examples:
\begin{codeblock}
void testJThread() 
{
  std::jthread t([] {
                   while (...) {
                     std:this_thread::throw_if_interrupted();
                     ...
                     // temporarily disable interrupts:
                     auto origToken = std::this_thread::exchange_interrupt_token(std::interrupt_token{});
                     ...
                     std::this_thread::exchange_interrupt_token(origToken);
                     ...
                   }
                 });
  ...
} // jthread destructor signals interrupt and therefore silently ends the started thread
\end{codeblock}

\begin{codeblock}
void testInterruptibleCVWait() 
{
  bool ready = false;
  std::mutex readyMutex;
  std::condition_variable readyCV;
  std::jthread t([&ready, &readyMutex, &readyCV] {
                    while (...) {
                      ...
                      {
                        std::unique_lock lg{readyMutex};
                        readyCV.iwait_for(lg,
                                          std::chrono::seconds(2),
                                          [&ready] {
                                             return ready;
                                          });
                      }
                      ...
                    }
                  });
  ...
} // jthread destructor signals interrupt and therefore unblocks the CV wait and silently ends the started thread
\end{codeblock}

\subsubsection*{Feature Test Macro}

This is a new feature so that it shall have the following feature macro:
\begin{codeblock}
	__cpp_lib_jthread
\end{codeblock}
